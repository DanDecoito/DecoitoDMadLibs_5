Help me improve

Peer Review: Brandon Le - The story works as intended and I'm able to play through and I'm also able to restart. I liked how you could type anything you wanted in order to play again, so it didn't matter if you made a spelling mistake. I haven't seen something like that yet so it was nice to see something different. There also needs to be data validation. But good job overall!
